# http2-pusher

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/adamhenson/http2-pusher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adamhenson/http2-pusher)

> A mechanism to execute HTTP/2 server push in an organized approach.

## Dependencies
This depends on a request object returned from a server routing mechanism. Currently it's only been tested with the [http2 package](https://github.com/molnarg/node-http2) ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http2)).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install http2-pusher --save
```

## Example Usage
[See a rough example here](https://github.com/adamhenson/http2-demo/blob/express/server.js). It uses [the same router Express uses](https://github.com/pillarjs/router).

## Want More?
Don't worry more documentation, testing and examples coming soon.
